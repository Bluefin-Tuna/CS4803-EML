**Import Libraries:**  \n","    Load all required libraries for model handling, generation, and visualization.  \n","  - **Configure Environment:**  \n","    Define a `set_seed` function to ensure reproducibility by fixing random seeds.  \n","    Verify that a **GPU** is available for efficient computation.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Step 2: Model Loading (Cell 4)**\n","\n","- **Objective:**  \n","  Load the target **Llama 3-8B Instruct** model and prepare it for inference.\n","\n","- **Actions:**\n","  - **Select Model:**  \n","    Set `MODEL_ID = \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\"`.  \n","  - **Load with Fallback:**  \n","    Use a `try...except` block to attempt loading the main model.  \n","    If it fails (e.g., due to limited memory), load a smaller fallback model (`FALLBACK_MODEL_ID`) to ensure the notebook remains executable.  \n","  - **Model Summary:**  \n","    Print key information about the loaded model, including size and configuration.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Step 3: Experiment 1 — Effect of Temperature on Diversity (Cell 5)**\n","\n","- **Objective:**  \n","  Understand how the **temperature** hyperparameter influences the **randomness and diversity** of generated text.\n","\n","- **Actions:**\n","  - **Set Parameters:**  \n","    Define a fixed input `PROMPT` and a list of `TEMPERATURES` to test.  \n","  - **Generate Samples:**  \n","    Loop through each temperature value and generate multiple text samples using  \n","    `model.generate(..., do_sample=True)` so that temperature actually affects randomness.  \n","  - **Record Results:**  \n","    Save all generated outputs for side-by-side comparison and qualitative analysis.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Step 4: Experiment 2 — Input Length vs. Prefill Latency (Cell 6)**\n","\n","- **Objective:**  \n","  Demonstrate that **longer input sequences** lead to **higher prefill latency** before generation begins.\n","\n","- **Actions:**\n","  - **Define Input Sizes:**  \n","    Create a list of token lengths (`INPUT_LENGTHS`) to test various input sizes.  \n","  - **Precise Timing:**  \n","    Use `torch.cuda.Event` for high-precision GPU time measurement.  \n","  - **Measure Prefill Stage:**  \n","    For each input length, perform warm-up runs, then measure time for generating one token (`max_new_tokens=1`) to isolate prefill cost.  \n","  - **Visualize:**  \n","    Plot a line graph showing **input length (x-axis)** vs. **average latency (y-axis)**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Step 5: Experiment 3 — Real-Time Memory Tracking During Generation (Cell 8)**\n","\n","- **Objective:**  \n","  Track and visualize **GPU memory usage** step-by-step as tokens are generated, illustrating the growth of the **KV Cache**.\n","\n","- **Actions:**\n","  - **Design a “Memory Hook”:**  \n","    Implement a custom class `MemoryUsageCallback` inheriting from `transformers.StoppingCriteria`.  \n","    Its `__call__` method records current GPU memory after each token generation, returning `False` to continue.  \n","  - **Run Monitored Generation:**  \n","    After GPU warm-up, create an instance of the callback and pass it to `model.generate()` via `stopping_criteria`.  \n","  - **Analyze and Plot:**  \n","    Convert recorded memory data into a DataFrame and plot the **memory usage curve** over generation steps.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Step 6: Verifying the Space Complexity of KV Cache (Cell 9)**\n","\n","- **Objective:**  \n","  Quantitatively confirm that memory usage grows **linearly** with sequence length — proving **O(L)** space complexity for the KV Cache.\n","\n","- **Actions:**\n","  - **Linear Regression:**  \n","    Apply `scipy.stats.linregress` to fit a linear model between the number of generated tokens and memory increase.  \n","  - **Interpret Results:**  \n","    - The **slope** indicates average memory growth (in MB) per generated token.  \n","    - The **R² value** close to 1 (e.g., > 0.99) validates a strong linear correlation, confirming the **O(L)** relationship.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Step 7: Summary and Analysis (Cell 10)**\n","\n","- **Objective:**  \n","  Summarize all experimental findings and explain the underlying principles observed.\n","\n","- **Actions:**\n","  - **Write Analysis:**  \n","    Discuss results and plots from all experiments, highlighting:  \n","    - The trade-off between temperature and diversity.  \n","    - The linear scaling of prefill latency with input length.  \n","    - The direct, linear memory growth due to KV caching.  \n","  - Synthesize these insights into a clear, data-driven conclusion about **LLM generation efficiency** and **scalability**.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"1b13aaf1","metadata":{"id":"1b13aaf1"},"outputs":[],"source":["### Cell 2: Environment Setup and Dependency Installation\n","# TODO: import all required libraries for the lab (os, random, time, numpy, pandas, torch, transformers, etc.)\n","\n","RESULTS_DIR = \"./results\"\n","FIGURES_DIR = \"./figures\"\n","\n","# TODO: create the results/figures directories if they do not exist\n","# os.makedirs(RESULTS_DIR, exist_ok=True)\n","# os.makedirs(FIGURES_DIR, exist_ok=True)\n","\n","# TODO: configure logging verbosity and select DEVICE (cuda vs. cpu)\n","# logging.set_verbosity_warning()\n","# if torch.cuda.is_available():\n","#     DEVICE = torch.device(\"cuda\")\n","#     # print GPU diagnostics here\n","# else:\n","#     DEVICE = torch.device(\"cpu\")\n","#     # print CPU-only notice\n","\n","# TODO: print environment diagnostics (CUDA version, PyTorch version, etc.)\n","\n","def set_seed(seed: int = 42) -> None:\n","    \"\"\"Seed Python, NumPy, and PyTorch RNGs for reproducible lab runs.\"\"\"\n","    ...\n","\n","def require_gpu(task: str) -> None:\n","    \"\"\"Raise a descriptive error if a GPU is required but not available.\"\"\"\n","    ...\n","\n","# TODO: call set_seed and configure visualisation defaults (sns, matplotlib)\n","# sns.set_theme(...)\n","# plt.rcParams.update(...)\n","# print(\"Environment initialised.\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"44365f03","metadata":{"id":"44365f03"},"outputs":[],"source":["# ### Cell 3: Hugging Face Login\n","# from huggingface_hub import login, HfFolder\n","# from getpass import getpass\n","\n","# # Check if a Hugging Face token is already set in the environment.\n","# if not os.getenv(\"HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN\"):\n","#     try:\n","#         # Prompt user for Hugging Face access token if not found.\n","#         hf_token = getpass(\"Please enter your Hugging Face access token: \")\n","#         login(token=hf_token, add_to_git_credential=True)\n","#         print(\"   Hugging Face login successful!\")\n","#     except Exception as e:\n","#         print(f\"Login failed: {e}.
