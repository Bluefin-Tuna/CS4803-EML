        "\n",
        "In Task 01, we explored basic pruning techniques that remove individual parameters or simple structures. However, real neural networks contain complex **architectural dependencies** between layers, modules, and components that must be carefully preserved during pruning. Ignoring these dependencies can lead to broken models, dimensional mismatches, or complete training failures.\n",

        "**Pruning Dependencies**: The interconnected relationships between network components that must be maintained during pruning. These include:\n",
        "- **Dimensional consistency**: Ensuring input/output dimensions match between connected layers\n",
        "- **Residual connections**: Maintaining skip connections in architectures like ResNet\n",
        "- **Batch normalization alignment**: Preserving feature map dimensions for normalization layers\n",
